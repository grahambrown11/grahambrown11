      <p>Most businesses use Open Source Software in some way, whether it’s bundled in a product they purchased or using it directly, however not many give back to those projects…</p>
<p>I’ve always wanted to start something open source or at least contribute to open source and this year was the pinnacle: I heard about Hacktoberfest - an initiative run by <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a> and <a href="https://dev.to/">DEV</a> getting people to submit 4 Pull Requests to Open Source, specifically on GitHub, in the month of October (a pull request is a request to accept the contribution to the code) and get a t-shirt. This gave me a reason to go beyond trying, so I signed up and started looking for issues tagged for Hacktoberfest. I looked for the low hanging fruit, but most of that was taken. I thought I&rsquo;d try marry my skills to a project that required help but getting to grips with the what, why and how was not going to be time well spent - starting with something you know lowers the barrier to entry: so I narrowed it down to things I use/work on every day at the office.</p>
<p>ARI4Java is used as part of an integrated solution between our CRM (Customer Relationship Management) and Asterisk (telephony) systems, I had previously worked on this project and the maintainer was looking for someone to help, so I jumped in. This project was where my 1st contribution got accepted, although that was a long time ago I recall feeling good for what I had done, not just fixing the issue for us but for a wider community. I met Lenz, the author of the project, at a conference. We got chatting about maintaining an open source project. There I was thinking that you need to be a genius and have some special powers but realised that he was an ordinary person who, like me, enjoys making software. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I still think he&rsquo;s a genius with special powers but with this new outlook I will now contribute where I can like I did for Hacktoberfest. I will finally publish a project I started a while back, which started started out as a proof of concept in a personal capacity. It is now used in our over 80 people call centre who use it every day even though it&rsquo;s nowhere near complete and I have doubts that it&rsquo;s good enough. Hopefully others will find it useful and potentially contribute to make it better and more complete.</p>
<p>A challenge to myself is to be more intentional about contributing to open source beyond Hacktoberfest going forward. If I may extend this challenge to you: be more involved - you don&rsquo;t have to be a programmer fixing bugs or enhancing the program, updating documentation or participating in the forums are also valuable contributions.</p>
